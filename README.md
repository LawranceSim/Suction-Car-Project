# Suction Car Project 🚗🧲

An Arduino-powered Bluetooth-controlled suction vehicle built as part of our Mechatronics course + competition.  
Yes, it failed the qualification test. Yes, we fixed it within a day after the competition. 😅

## 🔧 Features
- Bluetooth control (via Play Store mobile app)
- Mode switch: Car Mode ↔ Suction Mode
- Dual-axis servo-controlled arm (Up/Down + Left/Right)
- Suction mechanism using motor-generated pressure differential
- Built-in LED to indicate current mode
- Full recovery after hardware failure on competition day ⚠️
